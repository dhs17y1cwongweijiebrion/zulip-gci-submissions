Hello world
I am dhs17y1cwongweijiebrion. :tada:
I like to eat pancakes in maple syrup.
Yummy!
Other than that, Google code-in is a good experience for me.
I'm enjoying this process together with my classmates in school. This is so fun!
Me like eggs... Sunny side up eggs... Do you like eggs?
I like science. Science is a very interesting and intriguing subject. Somehow I am able to remember and understand science very fast compared to my other subjects like Geography or History.
I am currently trying to change from a pessimistic person to a optimistic person. Please support me in your hearts! :)
